In 1998, Nobel laureate Paul Krugman gave a famous, widely-mocked quote:

> By 2005, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s

Absurd, innit. Yet... Paul Krugman was right!

The simple way to measure the "impact on the economy" is through real GDP growth.

The important element is "relative" growth vs "absolute" growth. Look at this graph:

If you consider the y axis as some proxy for "things" to be a real, tangible thing that people can observe, than starting at "10" things and moving to "20" things is only an absolute change of "10" thingies. Yet, growing from "20" things to "40" things in the exact same time period is an absolute change of "20" thingies. It's twice as big!

Sam Altman said this in 2015, and I think it's my favorite quote of his:

> [when you are standing on the exponential curve of technology, it looks flat behind you and vertical in front of you. but it's just a curve.](https://x.com/sama/status/628997336719474688)

Let's say you're walking on this curve. Exponentials have this cool property that regardless where you differentiate them, $\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x$. Meaning, the slope we perceive on this line is $e^x$. Note that since its own derivative is _also_ $e^x$, the rate at which we notice the slope changing is also $e^x$. For sufficiently small $x$, that means the rate of change between slopes can _feel_ small, especially over a short horizon.

My theory is that we, as humans, experience progress in the absolute sense, and not in the relative sense. Simply, our primate brains are terrible at understanding exponential growth, and we can only see the curve being flat behind us, and impute that the curve in front of us is also flat. Additionally, even when the curve does grow steep, which it does as technology exponentially grows, our standards increase on the same rate, a concept referred to as the [hedonistic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill).

So yes, AI will change the world. Your lives will be drastically different once pure AGI is achieved. You will look back on the past and wonder, "how did I live my life before this!" Your parents probably say something similar about google, wondering how they were able to complete their undergrad. Sometimes, I even wonder how I would ask programming questions without ChatGPT.

But the point is that implicitly, your parents _were_ able to complete their undergrads without using google. I indeed had a rich life before the advent of personal cell phones. And without ChatGPT, I'd probably still be a good programmer. 

To be clear — I would wager that AI ceos, like Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, take advantage of our brains being poor at understanding exponentials to market their products. No real harm in this — they're CEOs, their jobs are to sell their products. 

The hype for AI is warranted. It's going to change your life. It's going to change your life by exactly 7-8% YoY, annualized.
