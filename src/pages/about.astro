                Howdy! I'm Abhi, and I build things and now try to write about
                them.
            </p>
            <p>Some things about me:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-outside ps-6 py-3">
                <li>
                    I was born in Texas, lived in Minnesota for 10 years, then
                    moved to northern mass. I now live in Cambridge, MA.
                </li>

                    I first learned how to code at the age of 12, when I was
                    taught C++ by a family friend. It was such a terrible
                    experience that I didn't touch programming for another
                    decade. Who expects a 12 year old to understand pointers!!
                </li>
                <li>
                    I graduated from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, where I
                    spent my undergrad studying math, economics, and physics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I watch a lot of professional Basketball, and am a diehard
                    Boston Celtics fan. I'm a part-time Connecticut Sun fan,
                    too.
                </li>
                <li>I have two kittens that I adore. <a>Cat tax</a>!</li>
                <li>
                    I consider myself a true full-stack engineer â€” I do
                    frontend, backend, devops, and cloud stuff! Jack of all
                    trades, alright at a few?
